## Menus
Shortcut could be created by specifying the `accelerator` attribute of the menu item 
*i.e. `Ctrl+Q` (Win and Linux) or `Command+Q` (Mac)*

> For multi platfrom purpose it recommented to check the current OS 
> ```js
> process.platfrom == 'darwin' ? 'Command+Q' : 'Ctrl+Q'
> ```

## MISC
* set a window to null after closing the free up the memory area

* update main window `closed` event by invoking the  
```js
  app.quit()
```

* disclude developer tools if the sw is a production code
```js
  if ( process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production')
```

* `ipcRenderer` very important to communicate between the app and the actual html view
  For a complete example of how to communicate between the the 'server' and the view check this video [youtube](https://youtu.be/kN1Czs0m1SU?t=1881)
